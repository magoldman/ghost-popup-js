# ghost-popup-js
A simple javascript script to make a substack-like subscribe here popup for ghost blogs

## Introduction
For folks who want to self-host a newsletter or blog, [Ghost](https://www.ghost.org) provides a wonderful option. However, it is missing a few features I wanted. One of these is a simple pop-up modal that encourages people to subscribe or share the post.

## Installation
Download the script, modify the settings in the top part (comments in code) and then copy and paste into the footer code injection in the admin.
